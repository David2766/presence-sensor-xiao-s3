# API Contract

This document defines how device APIs should report machine-readable status,
errors, and user-facing messages. The goal is to keep firmware, dashboard UI,
demo mode, and future integrations stable as the project grows.

This is not a full OpenAPI specification. It is a practical contract for this
project.

---

## 1. Scope

This contract applies first to APIs that return status or error information.
Existing APIs do not need to be rewritten all at once.

Initial targets:

- `/api/system/status`
- `/api/setup/*`
- Device config upload APIs
- Floorplan upload APIs
- Stats upload and backup/restore APIs
- Calibration-related APIs
- OTA upload and reboot confirmation flow
- Diagnostic/debug APIs

---

## 2. Core Rule

APIs should return stable codes for software and let the frontend decide the
display language.

Do this:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "calibration_pir_active",
    "severity": "warning",
    "detail": {
      "pir": true
    }
  }
}
```

Avoid this for new APIs:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "status": "PIR motion was detected, so calibration cannot start."
}
```

---

## 3. Response Shape

### 3.1 Success Response

Successful responses must use `ok: true`.

Recommended shape:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {},
  "status": {
    "code": "ready",
    "severity": "info",
    "detail": {}
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `ok` must be `true`.
- `data` contains domain data.
- `status` is optional when there is no useful state to report.
- If present, `status.code` must be stable and machine-readable.
- `status` must not be used for failure causes.

### 3.2 Failure Response

Failure responses must use `ok: false`.

Recommended shape:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "upload_session_mismatch",
    "severity": "error",
    "detail": {
      "expected": 2,
      "received": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- `ok` must be `false`.
- Failure cause must be placed in `error.code`.
- `error.severity` must be `warning` or `error`.
- `error.detail` should contain only small structured data.
- UI logic must not depend on `error.message`.

### 3.3 In-Progress Response

Long-running or deferred operations should return `ok: true` with a status code.

Example:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": {
    "code": "ota_reboot_waiting",
    "severity": "info",
    "detail": {
      "retryAfterMs": 2000
    }
  }
}
```

Use this for accepted operations, reboot waits, deferred actions, and polling
flows.

---

## 4. HTTP Status Code Rules

HTTP status codes describe the request/transport result. JSON `code` values
describe the device/domain state.

Recommended mapping:

| HTTP | Meaning | Use for |
|---:|---|---|
| 200 | OK | Normal synchronous success or state response |
| 202 | Accepted | Deferred action accepted, such as OTA/reboot/pending work |
| 400 | Bad Request | Missing parameter, invalid JSON, invalid target, bad chunk header |
| 401 | Unauthorized | API key or PSK is required but missing/invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden | Request is understood but blocked by current device state |
| 404 | Not Found | Unknown endpoint or resource |
| 409 | Conflict | Active session conflict, upload mismatch, operation already running |
| 413 | Payload Too Large | Upload or request body exceeds allowed size |
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | Unsupported `Content-Type` |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Unexpected firmware/storage/internal failure |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Device is temporarily unavailable, rebooting, or changing network state |

Examples:

- Upload session mismatch: HTTP `409`, error code `upload_session_mismatch`.
- Boot guard blocks reset: HTTP `403`, error code `boot_guard_active`.
- Oversized floorplan image: HTTP `413`, error code `upload_payload_too_large`.
- SPIFFS write failure: HTTP `500`, error code `storage_write_failed`.

---

## 5. Status and Error Object

`code`

- Stable machine-readable identifier.
- Use lowercase `snake_case`.
- Do not use a full sentence.
- Frontend logic should depend on this, not on display text.

`severity`

- One of `info`, `warning`, or `error`.
- Used for UI tone, logs, and diagnostics.

`detail`

- Structured data needed to explain the state.
- Keep it small because firmware memory is limited.
- Prefer numbers, booleans, ids, and short enum strings.

`message`

- Optional transitional field.
- May be used for logs or temporary backward compatibility.
- UI logic must not depend on this field.
- New UI work should prefer i18n text generated from `code`.

---

## 6. Code Naming Rules

Use domain prefixes when possible.

Examples:

- `setup_wifi_connecting`
- `setup_wifi_connected`
- `setup_wifi_failed`
- `setup_ready`
- `setup_scan_started`
- `setup_scan_failed`
- `setup_ap_close_scheduled`
- `setup_ap_closing`
- `ha_handoff_started`
- `api_client_waiting`
- `api_client_connected`
- `api_client_idle`
- `calibration_ready`
- `calibration_pir_active`
- `calibration_max_zones_reached`
- `upload_started`
- `upload_committed`
- `upload_session_mismatch`
- `ota_uploading`
- `ota_reboot_waiting`
- `ota_device_reappeared`
- `debug_snapshot_ready`

Do not encode UI text into the code.

Bad:

- `pir_motion_detected_cannot_start_calibration`
- `please_wait_for_home_assistant_connection`

Better:

- `calibration_pir_active`
- `api_client_waiting`

---

## 7. Code Registry

This registry starts small on purpose. Add codes only when they are used by
firmware, dashboard, mock mode, or documented external behavior.

request fields. Keep the legacy error string during migration, and put the
invalid `field` plus the affected `target` in `detail`.

| Endpoint group | Code | Severity | HTTP | Detail |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Control settings | `invalid_request` | error | 400 | `field`, `target` |

| `firmware_upload_aborted` | warning | 0 | Dashboard client aborted the firmware upload. | none |

### 7.3.1 Device Config Upload

Device configuration writes should use the same chunked upload pattern as
floorplan and stats data because zone, floorplan, and future multi-sensor
settings can exceed safe single-form request sizes.

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/config/upload/start`
- `POST /api/config/upload/chunk`
- `POST /api/config/upload/commit`

Rules:

- `start` requires `session` and `size`.
- `chunk` requires `session`, `offset`, and hex-encoded `data`.
- `commit` requires `session`.
- `commit` must reload the stored device config into the firmware cache before
  returning success.
- Single-form legacy writes such as `POST /api/config`, `POST /api/stats`,
  `POST /api/floorplan`, and `POST /api/floorplan/image` are removed from the
  embedded API. Dashboard and restore flows must use the chunked upload
  endpoints.

### 7.3.2 Floorplan Patch Writes

Small floorplan edits may use dedicated single-form patch endpoints instead of
re-uploading the full floorplan document. These endpoints are intentionally
limited to bounded, low-memory fields and must not be used for image uploads,
room geometry replacement, wall segment replacement, object list replacement, or
full restore flows.

Endpoints:

- `POST /api/floorplan/radar`
- `POST /api/floorplan/room-name`
- `POST /api/floorplan/occlusion`
- `POST /api/floorplan/objects`

Rules:

- `POST /api/floorplan/radar` requires form field `data`, a JSON object with
  `originPx`, `rotationDeg`, and `scale`.
- `POST /api/floorplan/room-name` requires form fields `id` and `name`.
- `POST /api/floorplan/occlusion` requires form field `data`, a JSON object
  with `ignoredEdges`.
- `POST /api/floorplan/objects` requires form field `data`, a JSON array of
  floorplan furniture objects.
- The device updates the stored floorplan config payload in place and keeps the
  raw-partition metadata authoritative.
- If a patch target is missing, invalid, or too large, the device returns the
  standard error envelope with `invalid_request`, `not_found`, or
  `upload_storage_failed`.
- Full floorplan document writes, initial saves, restore flows, room geometry
  edits, scale edits, wall segment edits, and image writes must continue to use
  `POST /api/floorplan/upload/start|chunk|commit`.

### 7.4 Calibration Codes

| Code | Severity | HTTP | Meaning | Detail |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `calibration_ready` | info | 200 | Calibration can start. | none |
| `calibration_started` | info | 200 | Calibration run started. | none |

| `calibration_pir_active` | warning | 409 | PIR motion prevents calibration start. | `pir` |
| `calibration_no_target` | warning | 409 | Calibration cannot start because no target is detected. | none |
| `calibration_multiple_targets` | warning | 409 | Calibration cannot start because multiple targets are detected. | `targetCount` |

| `calibration_candidate_failed` | error | 500 | Calibration could not create a correction zone candidate. | `samples`, `score` |
| `calibration_saved` | info | 200 | Calibration zone was saved. | `zone`, `count` |

### 7.5 OTA Codes

| Code | Severity | HTTP | Meaning | Detail |
|---|---|---:|---|---|

| `ota_reboot_waiting` | info | 202 | OTA upload completed and device is expected to reboot. | `retryAfterMs` |
| `ota_device_reappeared` | info | 200 | Device responded after OTA/reboot. | `version`, `buildTime` |
| `ota_verify_timeout` | warning | 503 | Device did not respond before timeout. | `timeoutMs` |

|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `debug_snapshot_ready` | info | 200 | Debug snapshot is available. | `timestamp` |
| `debug_events_ready` | info | 200 | Diagnostic event log is available. | `count`, `truncated`, `format` |

## 8. Frontend Rules

The dashboard should prefer `status.code` or `error.code` and map it to i18n
messages.

Example:

```ts
const code = response.error?.code ?? response.status?.code ?? "unknown";
const text = messages.status[code] ?? messages.status.unknown;
```

Fallback policy:

1. Use `code` if present.
2. If `code` is missing, use the existing legacy field.
3. If no known field is available, show a generic message.

The frontend should not parse Korean or English sentences to decide behavior.

---

## 9. Firmware Rules

Firmware should provide compact status codes and details. It should avoid adding
more user-facing sentences to API responses unless needed for temporary
compatibility.

Firmware should avoid large diagnostic payloads in normal endpoints. Use a
dedicated debug endpoint when richer diagnostics are needed.

Debug endpoints that can return many records should stream or chunk their
responses instead of building one large string in firmware memory.

Shadow diagnostics may include experimental computed fields such as tracker
state, track score, observation counters, and recommended presence. These fields
must not replace the stable device state until the firmware behavior has been
verified in real installations.

Replay diagnostics may expose newline-delimited samples through a dedicated
debug endpoint. Replay payloads are for offline testing and must not be embedded
inside normal status responses.

Replay diagnostics may append compact optional tuples over time. Consumers must
ignore unknown fields and must provide safe defaults for missing optional fields.
For example, the `ex` tuple reports exit-zone evidence as
`[exitActive, exitZoneMask, exitTargetCount, exitLastSeenAgeMs]`.

---

## 10. Compatibility Policy

Existing fields must not be removed immediately.

Migration should follow this pattern:

1. Add `code`, `severity`, and `detail` beside the existing response.
2. Update mock/demo API to return the same fields.
3. Update frontend to prefer code-based messages.
4. Keep legacy fields until the new path is stable.
5. Remove legacy dependencies only after dashboard and firmware are verified.

---

## 11. Migration Priority

Recommended order:

1. Diagnostics/debug APIs
2. Calibration status
3. Floorplan upload status and errors
4. Setup and Wi-Fi handoff status
5. OTA upload and reboot confirmation status
6. `/api/system/status`

Reason:

- Debug and calibration are easiest to isolate.
- Upload/setup/OTA flows are more sensitive and should be changed after the
  pattern is proven.
- `/api/system/status` is widely consumed, so it should be changed carefully.

---

## 12. Configuration Enums

Software zone types:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `detection` | Count targets inside the zone as zone presence. |
| `filter` | Treat targets inside the zone as false-positive candidates and block them. |
| `disabled` | Keep the zone in configuration but do not use it for detection. |
| `exit` | Mark a likely path where a person leaves the monitored area. This is exit evidence, not a filter. |

Calibration zone types:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `filter` | Block repeated false-positive candidates. |
| `reduced` | Delay filtering before accepting a repeated candidate. |
| `disabled` | Keep the calibration zone in configuration but do not use it. |

`exit` is only a software zone type. It must not be treated as a calibration
zone type and must not remove targets by itself.

Presence engine flags:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `legacyPresenceFallback` | `false` | Use the old lambda-based presence path instead of the tracker engine. This is a diagnostic fallback and must be explicitly enabled by the user. |

Older `trackerAssistPresence` values must not disable the tracker engine during
normal operation. Firmware should treat the tracker engine as the default unless
`legacyPresenceFallback` is explicitly `true`.

---

## 13. Do Not

Do not:

- Break existing API responses in one large change.
- Add new frontend logic that depends on display strings.
- Translate firmware messages directly in the API.
- Use long sentences as status codes.
- Put large logs into normal status responses.
- Change endpoint semantics while doing i18n work.
- Make peer devices exchange user-facing sentences.
- Merge coordinates from multiple sensors without explicit geometry setup.
- Use exit zones as filter zones.

---

## 14. Practical Rule for This Project

For now, new status-producing work should follow this rule:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": {
    "code": "feature_state",
    "severity": "info",
    "detail": {}
  }
}
```

Legacy string fields may remain, but new UI work should use `code` first.
